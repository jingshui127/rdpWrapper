## Overview

`RDP Wrapper` is a RDP setup and configuration utility

This tool is inspired by the [stascorp's rdpwrap project](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap), however it is written in pure .NET instead of Pascal/Delphi, and it can auto-generate configuration for new windows versions.

## Download

**The recommended way to get the program is BUILD from source**
- Install git, Visual Studio
- `git clone https://github.com/sergiye/rdpWrapper.git`
- build

**or download build from [releases](https://github.com/sergiye/rdpWrapper/releases).**
